# BruteForce-using-Python
This is a simle buteforce program using python.

Step 1: Place all the three programs in a single directory.
Step 2: Use "php -S localhost:8000" to start the PHP (Use VSCode terminal)
Step 3: Run bruteforce.py
Step 4: Use "http://localhost:8000/login.php" as page url and "admin" as the username.
Step 5: Make a text file containing passwords in the same directory.

You'll get the Login Successful! message if the password is in the list. The password or username can be changed from the login.php accordingly. 
I am looking for further inputs and modification in the codes.
